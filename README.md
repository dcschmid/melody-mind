# üéµ MelodyMind - The Ultimate Music Trivia Challenge üé∂

MelodyMind is an engaging and competitive music trivia game where players can test their knowledge
across various music genres. Whether you're a rock enthusiast, pop aficionado, or jazz expert, this
game offers a thrilling experience with multiple categories and rounds.

## üåê Internationalization & Fallback Language

All localized content uses English (`en`) as the single canonical fallback. If a specific piece of
translated data (category, question set, album/playlist metadata) is missing for the requested
language, the system transparently falls back to the English source variant. This keeps behavior
predictable, reduces redundant branching, and simplifies maintenance. See `docs/data-loading.md` for
architectural details.

### Supported Languages (Post Locale Purge ‚Äì October 2025)

Active UI/content languages (in routing & content collections):

`en`, `de`, `es`, `fr`, `it`, `pt`

Deprecated / removed legacy locales purged on 2025‚Äë10‚Äë09 to reduce repository size and build
complexity:

`cn`, `da`, `fi`, `jp`, `nl`, `ru`, `sv`, `uk`

Rationale:

- Large volume of stale knowledge articles (‚âà1,100 markdown files) provided no current product value
- Reduced editor noise + faster grep/search ergonomics
- Avoids accidental drift of untranslated legacy content

Guidelines for (Re)Adding a Locale:

1. Add locale code to the central supported locales constant (`src/constants/languages.ts`).
2. Provide an English source template then derive translation files (see i18n generation scripts in
   `scripts/`).
3. Add content collections or data (categories, knowledge) only once translation coverage reaches an
   agreed threshold.
4. Keep fallback semantics (single fallback = `en`) ‚Äî do not introduce multi‚Äëstage fallback chains.

If a previously removed locale must return, reintroduce it explicitly instead of resurrecting old
purged markdown from history without review.

### Build Footprint Snapshot (post Favicon Optimization & Locale Feed Prune)

Date: 2025‚Äë10‚Äë09 (after pruning legacy locales & optimizing favicon)

| Artifact Type            | Approx Size |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Total `dist/`            | ~1.3 GB     |
| Client HTML (aggregated) | ~239 MB     |
| All JS (aggregated)      | ~299 KB     |
| All CSS (aggregated)     | ~141 KB     |
| Favicon (source)         | 447 bytes   |
| Favicon (copied in dist) | ~12 KB      |

Recent Optimizations:

- Removed eight deprecated locale content trees (‚âà1,124 markdown files) and associated category JSON
  plus feed source arrays.
- Replaced an anomalously large `favicon.svg` (‚âà1.98 MB) with a lean vector (447 B source), cutting
  an unnecessary transfer overhead and improving cache priming.
- Pruned dead RSS/news feed source definitions for removed locales to prevent accidental
  regeneration.

Observations:

- HTML still dominates (expected due to full static rendering for thousands of knowledge pages
  across 6 locales).
- Core JS & CSS remain lightweight, supporting fast hydration and low main‚Äëthread cost.
- Further reduction paths likely center on: selective route generation, knowledge page pagination /
  summarization, image variant deduplication.

Potential Follow‚ÄëUps (Not Yet Executed):

- Evaluate skipping generation of seldom‚Äëvisited long‚Äëtail knowledge routes or introducing on‚Äëdemand
  ISR style rebuilds if framework support evolves.
- Audit image variants for redundant resolutions or format duplication.
- Investigate HTML streaming or segmented builds if peak memory pressure becomes a blocker.

This snapshot supersedes earlier pre‚Äëoptimization notes and serves as the new baseline for
subsequent performance work.

## üîß Technologies Used

- Astro.js: For building the static and dynamic pages of the application.
- TypeScript: To ensure type safety and provide better developer experience.
- Static JSON & Markdown Data: All questions, genres, and content are stored as static assets (no
  external database).

## ü§ñ AI Coding Agents

For automated or AI-assisted contributions, see `AGENTS.md` for project-specific agent guidelines
(commands, coding standards, performance, accessibility, and safety rules). Human contributors can
largely ignore it unless curious about automation practices.

## üé® Styling Architecture

The CSS layer follows a token ‚Üí semantic mapping split:

- `src/styles/tokens.css`: Pure design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, radii, shadows,
  durations, easing, focus baseline, icon sizes, opacity, scrollbar dimensions, achievement colors)
- `src/styles/base.css`: Semantic/UI variables (forms, buttons, cards, interactive states, scrollbar
  color semantics) + environment adaptation media queries
- `src/styles/utilities.css`: Minimal utility classes (currently only screen-reader helper)
- `src/styles/global.css`: Keeps only imports; no variables live here anymore

Rationale, maintenance checklist, and extension guidance live in `docs/styles.md`.

## üîç SEO Architecture (Summary)

All pages use a unified SEO pipeline via `buildPageSeo` (see `docs/seo-architecture.md`). Deprecated
helper files (`seoText.ts`, `metaUtils.ts`, `seoBasics.ts`) were removed in October 2025. Do not
reintroduce per-page ad‚Äëhoc meta generation; instead provide:

- Base `title`, `description`, `url`
- Optional `enrichedParts` (array of semantic strings)
- Optional `fallbackKeywords` (curated terms)
- `structuredData` (JSON-LD objects) & `breadcrumbs`

The builder normalizes title suffixes, derives description & keywords, assembles robots directives,
and injects `BreadcrumbList` if missing.

## üß© Content Layer Migration

This project uses Astro's new Content Layer compatibility mode for legacy `type: "content"`
collections. Migration rationale, explicit collection declarations, and reviewed breaking changes
are documented in `MIGRATION_CONTENT_LAYER.md`. If you add new knowledge collections (e.g.
additional languages), ensure they are declared in `src/content/config.ts`.

## üìÇ Category Data Architecture

Categories are now handled through a clear separation of responsibilities to keep memory footprint,
complexity and coupling low:

- Loader (I/O + fallback resolution): `src/utils/category/categoryLoader.ts`
  - Provides `loadCategoriesForLanguage(lang)` and `loadCategoryBySlug(slug, { language })`.
  - Performs lazy loading via `import.meta.glob` through an internal index (`categoriesIndex.ts`).
  - Applies a single canonical fallback to English (`en`) if a localized category set is missing.

- Pure transforms (in‚Äëmemory operations only): `src/utils/category/categoryTransforms.ts`
  - `filterPlayableCategories`, `filterNonPlayableCategories`
  - `getCategoryStats`, `getCategoriesByType`
  - `isPlayableCategory` (type guard)
  - `searchCategories` (text search across headline/subline/body/slug)
  - All functions are side‚Äëeffect free and tree‚Äëshakable.

Removed / deprecated:

- Legacy wrapper utilities (`categoryLoadingUtils.ts`) and unused sorts were removed in Oct 2025 to
  avoid divergent logic and reduce cognitive load.

Design principles:

- A single fallback path keeps logic deterministic.
- I/O kept isolated so transforms remain easily testable later.
- No runtime language ‚Äúdetection‚Äù ‚Äî route param drives locale; fallback only when data absent.

When adding new category logic:

1. Put data fetching / fallback logic in the loader.
2. Keep any data shaping, filtering, aggregation pure in the transforms file (or a new dedicated
   transform module if unrelated to categories).
3. Avoid re‚Äëintroducing combined loader+transform helpers; compose them at call sites instead for
   clarity and tree‚Äëshaking.

This structure improves build memory behavior and future test coverage readiness while staying
aligned with the overall minimal client‚ÄëJS philosophy.
