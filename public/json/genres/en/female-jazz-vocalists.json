Around this time, she won the DownBeat Jazz Poll's Best Female Vocalist award, a significant accolade in the jazz community that reflected her status as one of the leading jazz singers of the era. The DownBeat magazine's annual poll has historically recognized outstanding contributions by jazz artists, helping to cement their legacy.

This method involved placing the microphone very near to the singer, which reduced ambient noise and allowed subtle emotional expressions to be preserved. At that time, the use of ribbon microphones was cutting-edge, providing a warm and natural sound ideal for jazz vocals.

          "trivia": "On the album 'Confessions,' recorded in 2019, Veronica Swift's vocals were primarily captured using the Neumann U87 microphone, a classic choice renowned for its warm and clear sound, especially favored in jazz vocal recordings. The U87 is a large-diaphragm condenser microphone that has been an industry standard since the 1960s, prized for its ability to faithfully reproduce the nuances of a singer’s voice. While alternatives like the AKG C414 and Rode NT1-A are also popular in studio settings, the U87's rich tonal characteristics helped bring out the intimate and expressive qualities of Swift’s performances on the album. The Shure SM57, typically used for instruments rather than vocals, was not the primary mic for this project. This microphone choice contributed significantly to the polished and immersive sound that characterizes 'Confessions.'"
