However, despite the strong lineup and critical appreciation in blues circles, the album did not achieve commercial success and failed to chart on the Billboard 200 or R&B Albums charts. This lack of chart presence reflects the challenges blues artists, especially African American women at the time, faced in breaking into mainstream commercial markets during the mid-1960s. Additionally, the blues genre was undergoing shifts, with rock and soul gaining more widespread popularity, which influenced the commercial reception of traditional blues albums like this one."

Despite these critiques, the album played a role in exposing Thornton to a new generation of blues and rock audiences, even if it did not achieve immediate commercial success. The project stands as an important cultural artifact illustrating the evolving dynamics of blues music during that era."

Her album thus serves as both a musical and cultural document of African American life at the time."
