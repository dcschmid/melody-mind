The Martin D-28 has long been favored by country and folk artists for its balanced sound, which complemented Harris's clear vocals and the album's blend of country and folk styles. While electric guitars like the Gibson Les Paul and Fender Stratocaster were popular in rock genres, Harris's choice highlighted her roots in traditional acoustic instrumentation. The Taylor 814ce, a more modern acoustic guitar model, was not yet introduced at the time of this album's recording. This choice of instrument contributed significantly to the warm, authentic sound that helped establish Emmylou Harris as a key figure in the country music scene during the mid-1970s."

This device was a pioneering digital pitch-shifting unit that allowed producers to manipulate vocal tracks in new and creative ways, becoming popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. While analog tape delay and direct injection techniques were commonly used in country music recordings of that era, the Eventide Harmonizer stood out as a cutting-edge tool. The album's producer, Jim Ed Norman, was known for incorporating modern studio technology to achieve polished soundscapes. This innovation contributed to the smooth and layered vocal textures that helped Janie Fricke's work stand out on the country charts during the early 1980s."

This stylistic choice helped set 'Blue' apart by appealing to traditional country audiences and preserving the genre's roots. The album's sound was often noted for its authenticity and maturity, especially given Rimes' young age of 13 at the time of release.

Wanda Jackson's album 'Right or Wrong' utilized close-miking techniques, which brought her distinctive voice to the forefront, enhancing emotional delivery and clarity. This method involved placing the microphone very near to the vocalist, reducing ambient noise and allowing subtle vocal inflections to be picked up with greater detail.
