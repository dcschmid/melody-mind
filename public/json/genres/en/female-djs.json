Despite not breaking into the top 40, 'Anemik' was well-received in electronic and indie music circles, which helped solidify Dinky's reputation in the Belgian electronic scene. The album's performance contrasted with some of Dinky's earlier singles, which had better visibility on club and dance charts. This charting position underscores the album's role as a cult favorite rather than a commercial blockbuster in 2009."

Sidechain compression was widely adopted in electronic dance music production around the mid-2000s, and Lisa Lashes' use of it helped emphasize the dynamic interplay between percussion and melodic elements on 'Lashed Out!'. Unlike analog tape saturation or binaural recording, which serve different sonic purposes, sidechain compression specifically impacts the groove and dancefloor appeal.

          "trivia": "Little Boots' debut album 'Hands' is notable for its rich electro-pop sound characterized by vibrant synthesizer textures. The Roland Juno-106 synthesizer was a key instrument used in the production, contributing lush analog pads and warm basslines that define many tracks on the album. This synth is renowned for its distinctive chorus effect and user-friendly interface, making it a favorite among electronic musicians in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. While other synths like the Moog Minimoog and Korg MS-20 were popular for their distinct analog sounds, the Juno-106's smooth and ethereal qualities perfectly complemented Little Boots' melodic style. The album's production, influenced by the resurgence of synth-pop in the late 2000s, helped cement 'Hands' as a defining record in modern electronic pop music."

          "trivia": "Little Boots' debut album 'Hands' from 2009 prominently features the Roland Juno-106 synthesizer, a classic analog synth known for its warm pads and punchy bass sounds. The Juno-106 was instrumental in crafting the album's electro-pop aesthetic, contributing to tracks like 'New in Town' and 'Remedy'. Alongside this, producer Greg Kurstin helped blend vintage synth tones with contemporary production techniques, giving the record its distinctive late-2000s electropop feel. The choice of the Juno-106 aligns with the era's revival of 1980s synth sounds in indie and pop music. Notably, other synths like the Moog Minimoog and Korg MS-20 were also popular among synth-pop artists but were not as central to 'Hands' as the Juno-106."
