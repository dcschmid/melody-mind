## Prioritized Recommendations

1. [Low Priority] Consider adding a Reset Filters button for easier navigation:

   ```html
   <button class="achievement-filter__reset" aria-label="Filters zurücksetzen">Zurücksetzen</button>
   ```

2. [Low Priority] Consider adding filter counts to show the number of options in each category:

   ```html

   ```

## Implementation Timeline

- **Immediate (1-2 days)**: No immediate action required
- **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**: No critical issues to address
- **Medium-term (2-4 weeks)**: Consider implementing the reset filters button
- **Long-term (1-3 months)**: Consider adding keyboard shortcut documentation
