## Detailed Recommendations

### Immediate Improvements (High Priority)

1. **Add missing translation keys for enhanced ARIA labels**

```typescript
// Add to translation files (en.json, de.json, etc.):
{
  "achievements.category.count": "Contains {count} achievements",
  "achievements.summary.total-aria": "Total achievements: {count}",
  "achievements.summary.unlocked-aria": "Unlocked achievements: {count}",
  "achievements.summary.progress-aria": "Progress: {percent} percent complete",
  "accessibility.skip-to-content": "Skip to main content",
  "accessibility.loading.achievements": "Loading achievements...",
  "accessibility.achievements.loaded": "Achievements loaded successfully"
}
```

2. **Implement loading states with enhanced ARIA support**

```astro
<!-- Add to achievements page during data fetching -->{
  loading && (
    <div class="achievements__loading" aria-busy="true" aria-live="polite" role="status">
      {t("accessibility.loading.achievements")}
    </div>
  )
}
```

3. **Enhance filter component accessibility verification**

- Complete keyboard navigation testing
- Verify ARIA states for filter selections
- Test focus management during dynamic filtering
- Ensure filter changes are announced to screen readers

### Medium Priority Enhancements

1. **Advanced keyboard navigation within achievement grids**

```javascript
// Implement arrow key navigation for achievement cards
function enhanceGridNavigation() {
  const grids = document.querySelectorAll(".achievements__grid");
  grids.forEach((grid) => {
    grid.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
      if (["ArrowUp", "ArrowDown", "ArrowLeft", "ArrowRight"].includes(e.key)) {
        // Navigate between achievement cards
        navigateGrid(e.key, grid);
      }
    });
  });
}
```

2. **Enhanced screen reader announcements for dynamic content**

```javascript
// Announce achievement count changes
function announceAchievementChanges(filteredCount, totalCount) {
  const announcement = `Showing ${filteredCount} of ${totalCount} achievements`;
  updateLiveRegion(announcement);
}
```

### Low Priority Enhancements

1. **Voice control optimization**

- Add data-voice-label attributes for better voice software support
- Implement predictable voice command patterns

2. **Advanced accessibility features**

- High contrast theme switching
- Font size adjustment controls
- Reading mode toggle
