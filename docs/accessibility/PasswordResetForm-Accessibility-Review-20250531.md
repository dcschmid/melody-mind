}
```

✅ **Accessibility-First Component Structure**

```astro
---
/**
 * PasswordResetForm - Accessible password reset component
 * Implements WCAG 2.2 AAA standards with comprehensive screen reader support
 */
import { getLangFromUrl, useTranslations } from "@utils/i18n";

interface Props {
  mode?: "request" | "confirm";
  email?: string;
  className?: string;
}

const { mode = "request", email, className } = Astro.props;
const lang = getLangFromUrl(Astro.url);
const t = useTranslations(lang);

// Enhanced accessibility features
const formId = `password-reset-${mode}-${Date.now()}`;
const instructionsId = `${formId}-instructions`;
const errorsId = `${formId}-errors`;
---

<form
  id={formId}
  class={`password-reset-form ${className || ""}`}
  aria-describedby={`${instructionsId} ${errorsId}`}
  novalidate
>
  <!-- Comprehensive form implementation -->
</form>
```

✅ **Advanced TypeScript Integration**

```typescript
/**
 * Enhanced password strength calculation with accessibility support
 */
export interface PasswordStrengthResult {
  score: number;
  percentage: number;
  level: "sehr-schwach" | "schwach" | "mittel" | "stark" | "sehr-stark";
  ariaLabel: string;
  suggestions: string[];
}

export const calculatePasswordStrength = (
  password: string,
  lang: string
): PasswordStrengthResult => {
  // Implementation with German accessibility support
  const strength = calculateEntropy(password);
  const percentage = Math.min(100, (strength / 100) * 100);

  return {
    score: strength,
    percentage,
    level: getStrengthLevel(percentage),
    ariaLabel: getAccessibleStrengthDescription(percentage, lang),
    suggestions: getPasswordSuggestions(password, lang),
  };
