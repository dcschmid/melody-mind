## Detailed Recommendations

### High Priority Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced Semantic Structure
```astro
<div class="music-buttons" role="group" aria-labelledby="music-platforms-heading">
  <h3 id="music-platforms-heading" class="sr-only">
    {title} - Available Music Platforms
  </h3>
  {/* existing button mapping */}
</div>
```

#### 2. Improved ARIA Labels with Context
```astro
aria-label={`Listen to ${title} on ${label} - Opens ${label} music platform in new tab. May require ${label} account or subscription.`}
```

#### 3. Keyboard Navigation Instructions
```astro
<div class="music-buttons-instructions sr-only" aria-live="polite">
  Press Tab to navigate between music platforms. Press Enter or Space to open selected platform in new tab.
</div>
```

### Medium Priority Improvements

#### 4. Loading State Enhancement
```typescript
// Add to ButtonLink component usage
aria-describedby="loading-instructions"
data-loading-text="Opening ${label}..."
```

#### 5. External Platform Accessibility Notice
```astro
<div id="external-platform-notice" class="sr-only">
  Note: Music platforms may have their own accessibility features and requirements. 
  Contact platform support for accessibility assistance.
</div>
```

#### 6. Error Handling for Failed Links
```typescript
// Add error handling for broken external links
const handleLinkError = (platform: string) => {
  // Announce error to screen readers
  // Provide alternative access methods
};
```

### Low Priority Enhancements

#### 7. Platform-Specific Icons Accessibility
```astro
<Icon 
  name={type} 
  class="music-button__icon" 
  aria-hidden="true"
  title={`${label} logo`}
/>
```

#### 8. Enhanced Focus Announcements
```css
:global(.music-button:focus-visible::after) {
  content: " - Press Enter to open in new tab";
  position: absolute;
  left: -10000px; /* Screen reader only */
}
```

## Implementation Priorities

1. Add `role="group"` and `aria-labelledby` to container
2. Enhance aria-labels with platform context
3. Add keyboard navigation instructions

### Next Sprint
1. Implement loading state indicators
2. Add external platform accessibility notices
3. Create error handling for failed links

### Future Considerations
