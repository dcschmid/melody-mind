## WCAG 2.2 AAA Specific Compliance

### New Success Criteria Compliance

✅ **2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) - AAA**

- All interactive elements meet 44x44px minimum size
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements

✅ **3.2.6 Consistent Help - AAA**

- Consistent error messaging and user guidance
- Predictable component behavior across contexts

✅ **4.1.3 Status Messages - AA (Enhanced Implementation)**

- Proper role="status" implementation
- Dynamic announcement support for loading state changes

✅ **Enhanced Focus Appearance (Future WCAG)**

- Implements enhanced focus indicators where applicable
- Proper contrast ratios for focus states

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Priority 1 (High Impact)

1. **Enhanced ARIA Labeling**

   ```html
   <div
     class="loading-spinner hidden"
     role="status"
     aria-live="polite"
     aria-busy="false"
     aria-label="Loading progress indicator"
     data-testid="loading-spinner"
   ></div>
   ```

2. **Progress Information** Consider adding support for determinate progress when possible:
   ```html
   <div role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="0" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"></div>
   ```

### Priority 2 (Medium Impact)

1. **Improved Screen Reader Context** Add more descriptive announcements:

   ```typescript
   const contextualAnnouncements = {
     gameLoading: "Loading game content, please wait",
     questionLoading: "Loading next question",
     resultsLoading: "Calculating results",
   };
   ```

2. **Focus Management Enhancement**
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Optionally moves focus to the spinner for better screen reader experience
    */
   showWithFocus(): boolean {
     const success = this.show();
     if (success && this.spinner) {
       this.spinner.setAttribute('tabindex', '-1');
       this.spinner.focus();
     }
     return success;
   }
   ```

### Priority 3 (Low Impact)

1. **Enhanced Error States** Add support for error/timeout states:

   ```html
   <div class="loading-spinner loading-spinner--error" role="alert"></div>
   ```

2. **Improved Animation Performance** Consider using CSS transforms only:
   ```css
   @keyframes spin {
     to {
       transform: translateZ(0) rotateZ(360deg);
     }
   }
   ```

## Implementation Validation
