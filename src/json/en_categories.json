The sound is both hypnotic and futuristic: repetitive rhythms, minimal chord changes, strange textures, and a fearless openness to experimentation. Krautrock was not built for radio singles but for journeys—long, trance-like explorations where sound itself became an adventure. It spoke of freedom, modernity, and a refusal to imitate. Close your eyes, let the beat roll, and lose yourself in the endless pulse. Clap in rhythm, sway with the repetition, and step into the future Krautrock imagined!",

    "text": "Garage Rock began in the mid-1960s as young bands filled basements and garages with raw, unrefined sound. The Kingsmen roared with “Louie Louie,” The Sonics pushed distortion to new extremes, and later The Stooges gave punk its primal blueprint. Decades later, The White Stripes and The Hives revived garage fury for a new generation. The hallmark of Garage Rock is its simplicity: fuzzy guitar chords, pounding drums, shouted vocals, and a rough, almost careless energy that feels alive. It’s about passion over polish, attitude over perfection. Every note feels like it could fall apart yet somehow stays together with thrilling urgency. Garage Rock carries rebellion, fun, and the spirit of do-it-yourself creativity. You don’t need virtuosity—you need volume and nerve. Stomp the floor, clap with abandon, and scream the words until your voice cracks. Garage Rock is proof that pure energy is all you need—so turn it up and let loose!",

    "text": "Punk erupted in the mid-1970s as a direct reaction against bloated stadium rock and mainstream excess. The Ramones blasted through New York with short, fast, three-chord anthems. Across the Atlantic, the Sex Pistols shocked Britain with sneers and rebellion, while The Clash gave punk political fire. Later, Dead Kennedys added razor-sharp satire, and Green Day carried the torch into the 90s, sparking a new wave. Punk thrives on speed, simplicity, and attitude: buzzing guitars, rapid drum beats, and vocals that spit defiance. Concerts turned into mosh pits of sweat, energy, and collective release. Punk is less about virtuosity and more about honesty—it says anyone can grab a guitar, shout their truth, and shake the system. The spirit is alive in every chord: furious, urgent, unfiltered. So dive in, raise your fist, and scream until your lungs burn—Punk calls you to live loud, raw, and free!",

    "text": "Gothic Rock emerged in the late 1970s as post-punk bands explored darker moods and atmospheric soundscapes. Bauhaus set the tone with “Bela Lugosi’s Dead,” while Siouxsie and the Banshees combined sharp guitars with haunting vocals. The Sisters of Mercy brought deep, echoing bass and drum machine beats, and Fields of the Nephilim added mysticism and cinematic grandeur. In the 80s and 90s, The Cure’s gloomy yet melodic songs gave gothic its most enduring anthems. The music is defined by brooding basslines, shimmering guitar drenched in reverb, and vocals that shift between whisper, cry, and chant. Beyond sound, it became a subculture: black clothes, smoky clubs, and a love of mystery. Gothic Rock is not just about darkness, but about finding beauty inside it. Listen for echoes, shadows, and intensity in every note. Raise your voice, sway to the deep pulse, and let the music guide you through night’s embrace—Gothic Rock is waiting for you.",
