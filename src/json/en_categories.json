    "text": "Women in rock and metal have shattered stereotypes with volume and fire. Joan Jett kicked doors open with gritty riffs and anthems like “I Love Rock ’n’ Roll.” Doro Pesch became the “Metal Queen,” leading heavy stages with leather, growls, and endless energy. In symphonic metal, Floor Jansen of Nightwish blended operatic strength with raw metal force, while Amy Lee of Evanescence gave gothic rock soaring piano-driven drama. Lzzy Hale of Halestorm proved modern rock still had fierce female power. The sound is unmistakable: distorted guitars crunching, drums thundering, bass shaking, and voices ranging from angelic to guttural screams. These vocalists turned stages into battlefields of empowerment, proving rock is for everyone. Throw your horns up, bang your head, and scream the chorus — female rock and metal singers invite you to feel the storm inside!",
