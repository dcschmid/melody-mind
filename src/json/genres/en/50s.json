This limited Cooke's ability to record his vocals independently from the instruments, which made achieving the perfect balance between his powerful voice and the musical accompaniment more complex. At that time, most studios used two-track tape, meaning adjustments could only be made during the mix rather than in isolation. Sam Cooke's innovative approach and vocal prowess, combined with the constraints of the era, ultimately shaped the album's distinctive sound and cemented his legacy in the music industry."
