biography: Christopher Wallace, known professionally as The Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, or Big Poppa, was born on May 21, 1972, in Brooklyn, New York, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, known for his distinctive flow, vivid storytelling, and impactful contributions to East Coast hip-hop. He rose to fame in the mid-1990s with his debut album Ready to Die (1994), which established him as a master storyteller with hits like Big Poppa and One More Chance, while his feud with West Coast rapper Tupac Shakur became one of hip-hop's most legendary rivalries. His 1997 posthumous album Life After Death, released just weeks after his death from a shooting in Los Angeles, became a commercial triumph and is widely considered a hip-hop masterpiece. Wallace's influence on rap music and his legacy as a cultural icon have only grown since his tragic death at age 24.
