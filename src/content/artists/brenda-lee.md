biography: 'Brenda Lee, known as ''Little Miss Dynamite,'' was a child prodigy who became one of the most successful female vocalists of the 1960s. Despite standing only 4''9" (145 cm), she possessed a powerful, mature voice that commanded attention. Lee recorded her first songs at age 11 and achieved two consecutive number-one hits in 1960 with ''I''m Sorry'' and ''I Want to Be Wanted.'' Her career spans over 65 years, transitioning from rock and roll and pop to country music. Her enduring holiday classic ''Rockin'' Around the Christmas Tree'' (1958) remains one of the most-played Christmas songs decades later. Lee received induction into both Country Music Hall of Fame and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, solidifying her legacy across multiple genres.'
