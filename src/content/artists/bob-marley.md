  Bob Marley, born Robert Nesta Marley on February 6, 1945, in Nine Miles, Jamaica, became the defining figure of reggae music and a global cultural icon who formed The Wailing Rudeboys (later The Wailers) in 1963 with Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh. After discovering Rastafari in the late 1960s, his music evolved to include spiritual and political messages, with international breakthrough albums "Catch a Fire" (1973) and "Exodus" (1977) which spent 56 consecutive weeks on the UK charts. With over 75 million records sold, Marley became a world ambassador for reggae and a symbol of resistance and unity, receiving the UN Peace Medal in 1978 and posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. His 1984 compilation "Legend" has spent over 570 weeks on the Billboard charts, making it the best-selling reggae album of all time. Marley died of cancer on May 11, 1981, at age 36, but his message of "One Love" continues to inspire worldwide.
