biography: "LaVern Baker, born Delores LaVern Baker on November 11, 1929, in Chicago, Illinois, was an American R&B and rock and roll singer known for her powerful voice, dynamic stage presence, and string of hits in the 1950s and 1960s, recording for Atlantic Records from 1953 to 1966. Nicknamed 'Little Miss Sharecropper' early in her career, she released over 20 R&B chart hits including 6 number-one singles: 'Tweedle Dee,' 'Jim Dandy,' 'I Cried a Tear,' 'I Can't Love You Enough,' 'Saved,' and 'See See Rider,' bridging the gap between R&B and early rock and roll. Her songs made her one of the most successful female artists of the era, with early success including crossover appeal with white audiences, particularly with 'Tweedle Dee' which reached #5 on Billboard's Hot 100. A Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee (1991), Baker influenced generations of singers with her bold style and energetic performances, from Aretha Franklin and Tina Turner to Dusty Springfield and Donna Summer. She died on March 10, 1997, from cardiovascular disease in Bronx, New York at age 67, but her legacy as a pioneering R&B artist endures."
