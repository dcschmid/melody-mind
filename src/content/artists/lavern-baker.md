biography: "LaVern Baker, born Delores LaVern Baker, was an American R&B and rock and roll singer known for her powerful voice, dynamic stage presence, and string of hits in the 1950s and 1960s. Nicknamed 'Little Miss Sharecropper' early in her career, Baker recorded for Atlantic Records from 1953 to 1966, releasing over 20 R&B chart hits including 6 number-one singles: 'Tweedle Dee,' 'Jim Dandy,' 'I Cried a Tear,' 'I Can't Love You Enough,' 'Saved,' and 'See See Rider.' Her songs bridged the gap between R&B and early rock and roll, making her one of the most successful female artists of the era. A Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Baker influenced generations of singers with her bold style and energetic performances."
