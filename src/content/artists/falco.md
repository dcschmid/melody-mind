biography: "Johann Hölzel, known professionally as Falco, was born on February 19, 1957, in Vienna, Austria, and became Austria's most successful international musician, blending German lyrics with electronic disco and rock elements. He achieved global fame in 1982 with the hit Der Kommissar from his debut album Einzelhaft, which combined German rap verses with English choruses, pioneering the fusion of German and English pop music. His 1986 album Falco 3 reached #1 in over 20 countries and featured Rock Me Amadeus, which topped the charts worldwide and became the first German-language song to reach #1 on the U.S. charts since World War II. Falcos flamboyant personality, innovative musical style, and crossover appeal established him as a cultural bridge between European and American pop music, though his career was tragically cut short when he died in a car accident in the Dominican Republic on February 2, 1998, at age 40."
