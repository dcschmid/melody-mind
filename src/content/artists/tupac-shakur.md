biography: Tupac Amaru Shakur, known as 2Pac, Makaveli, or Pac, was born on June 16, 1971, in East Harlem, New York City, and is widely regarded as one of the most influential and best-selling rappers in music history, known for his passionate delivery, socially conscious lyrics, and controversial life that ended with his unsolved murder at age 25. He began his music career in 1991 with the album 2Pacalypse Now, which established him as a voice for urban youth with its politically charged content, and achieved commercial success with subsequent albums including Me Against the World (1995) and The Don Killuminati (1996). His feud with East Coast rapper The Notorious B.I.G. and his highly publicized legal troubles made him a cultural icon whose influence extended far beyond music into activism, film, and social commentary. Shakur's posthumously released albums have sold over 75 million records worldwide, cementing his legacy as one of the greatest artists of all time.
