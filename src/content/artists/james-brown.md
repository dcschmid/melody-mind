biography: |
  James Joseph Brown, born on May 3, 1933, in Barnwell, South Carolina, was the "Godfather of Soul" and one of the most influential artists in 20th-century music who revolutionized rhythm with "Cold Sweat" (1967), introducing the pattern that would become the foundation of funk and developing the call-and-response style and choreographed stage moves. Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he dominated with hits like "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" (1965), "I Got You (I Feel Good)" (1965), and "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" (1970), while his politically charged "Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud" (1968) became an anthem of the civil rights movement. With over 100 million records sold and influence extending to virtually every genre from hip-hop and R&B to rock and electronic music, Brown received numerous accolades including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2003 and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. Artists from Michael Jackson to Prince acknowledged his profound impact on music history, with his innovative approach to rhythm and performance shaping generations of musicians. Brown died on December 25, 2006, from pneumonia related to prostate cancer, but his legacy as a pioneering musician, performer, and cultural icon endures.
