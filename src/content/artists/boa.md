  - year: "2001"
    event: "Released Listen to My Heart in Japan, beginning her career in the competitive Japanese market that was known for its resistance to foreign artists and its sophisticated domestic music industry that had historically excluded non-Japanese performers. This expansion into Japan represented an unprecedented move by a Korean artist and required extensive preparation including language study and cultural adaptation. Her willingness to undertake this challenge demonstrated her ambition."
  - year: "2002"

The decision was pragmatic."
