biography: |
  Joan Baez, born Joan Chandos Baez on January 9, 1941, in Staten Island, New York, is an American folk singer and activist whose pure soprano voice and uncompromising commitment to social justice defined the 1960s folk revival, with breakthrough debut album "Joan Baez" (1960) establishing her crystalline voice as the definitive sound of her era. Throughout her career, Baez has been a relentless advocate for civil rights, anti-war causes, and environmental issues, with activism costing her mainstream popularity at times but remaining committed to using her platform for social change. She has won multiple Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017, with her influence on subsequent generations of folk and protest singers being immeasurable. Her performances of Bob Dylan songs helped establish him as a major artist, cementing her role in music history while her legacy as both a musical innovator and a principled activist remains defining. At 83, Baez continues to perform and record, though she has announced plans to retire from touring.
