  Marshall Bruce Mathers III, known professionally as Eminem, Slim Shady, or Marshall Mathers, born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time, known for his technical proficiency, complex rhyme schemes, and controversial lyrics that have sparked debate while also earning critical acclaim.

His 2000 album The Marshall Mathers LP became the fastest-selling album in history at the time, and his subsequent albums have continued to achieve commercial and critical success. Eminem has sold over 220 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists in history, and has successfully transitioned into film, entrepreneurship,
