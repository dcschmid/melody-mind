biography: |
  Muddy Waters, born McKinley Morganfield on April 4, 1913, in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, was an American blues musician widely considered the father of modern Chicago blues who transformed the rural Delta blues of his Mississippi youth into the amplified urban sound that defined the Chicago blues style. His recordings for Chess Records from 1947 to 1975, including classic tracks like "Hoochie Coochie Man," "Mannish Boy," and "I Just Want to Make Love to You," became essential repertoire for blues and rock musicians, influencing countless artists including The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, and Jimi Hendrix. Moving to Chicago in 1943, he began recording in the 1940s and developed the electric blues style that revolutionized the genre and influenced the development of rock and roll. A Grammy Hall of Fame inductee and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee (1987), Waters continued recording and performing throughout the 1960s and 1970s, bringing blues to international audiences while his influence on British blues bands and American rock musicians was profound. He died on April 30, 1983, in Chicago, but his legacy as one of the most important figures in American music history endures with "Hoochie Coochie Man" posthumously inducted into Grammy Hall of Fame (1999).
