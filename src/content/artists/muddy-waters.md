biography: "Muddy Waters, born McKinley Morganfield, was an American blues musician widely considered the father of modern Chicago blues. A guitarist, singer, and songwriter, Waters transformed the rural Delta blues of his Mississippi youth into the amplified urban sound that defined the Chicago blues style from the late 1940s through the 1960s. His recordings for Chess Records from 1947 to 1975, including classic tracks like 'Hoochie Coochie Man,' 'Mannish Boy,' and 'I Just Want to Make Love to You,' became essential repertoire for blues and rock musicians. A Grammy Hall of Fame inductee and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Waters influenced countless artists including The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, and Jimi Hendrix, making him one of the most important figures in American music history."
