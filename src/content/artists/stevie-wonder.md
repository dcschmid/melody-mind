biography: |
  Stevland Hardaway Morris, born Stevland Judson Hardaway on May 13, 1950, in Saginaw, Michigan, is a blind musical genius who revolutionized soul, R&B, funk, and pop music, beginning his career as Little Stevie Wonder at age 12 and becoming the youngest artist to top the Billboard charts with "Fingertips" in 1963. Throughout the 1970s he produced his most acclaimed work including "Talking Book" (1972), "Innervisions" (1973), "Fulfillingness' First Finale" (1974), and "Songs in the Key of Life" (1976), establishing him as one of the most creative and technically skilled musicians of his generation. Wonder pioneered the use of synthesizers, drum machines, and electronic instruments in popular music while his ability to play virtually every instrument on his recordings made him a one-man band whose complex arrangements influenced generations of musicians across virtually every genre from funk to hip-hop. With over 100 million records sold and 25 Grammy Awards making him one of the most awarded artists in Grammy history, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014 while his timeless classics like "Superstition," "I Just Called to Say I Love You," and "Isn't She Lovely" continue to resonate across generations worldwide. Beyond music, he has been a prominent activist for civil rights, education for the blind, and environmental causes, continuing to inspire with his message of love and unity.
