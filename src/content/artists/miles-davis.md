A master of reinvention, Davis pioneered or revolutionized multiple jazz styles: bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, and jazz fusion. His 1959 album 'Kind of Blue' remains the best-selling jazz album of all time with over 5 million copies sold. Known for his distinctive muted trumpet sound, sparse melodic playing, and ability to discover and nurture extraordinary talent, Davis shaped five decades of jazz evolution.
