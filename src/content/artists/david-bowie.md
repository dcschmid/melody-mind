biography: |
  David Bowie, born David Robert Jones on January 8, 1947, in Brixton, London, was a visionary English musician and cultural icon who constantly reinvented himself throughout his career, pioneering glam rock, art rock, and electronic music. His breakthrough came with "Space Oddity" (1969), but he achieved global stardom through his Ziggy Stardust persona on "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars" (1972), continuously transforming through Aladdin Sane to the Thin White Duke. Throughout the 1970s, he created the Berlin Trilogy ("Low," "Heroes," "Lodger") with Brian Eno, while also establishing himself as an actor in films including "The Man Who Fell to Earth" and "Labyrinth." With 140 million records sold worldwide and multiple Grammy awards, his 1983 album "Let's Dance" marked his commercial peak with three #1 hits. His 2016 album "Blackstar," released two days before his death from liver cancer, was universally acclaimed as a masterpiece, influencing virtually every musician who followed from Nirvana to Lady Gaga.
