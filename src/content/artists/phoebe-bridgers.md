biography: Phoebe Bridgers, born on August 17, 1994, in Pasadena, California, is an American singer-songwriter known for her introspective lyrics, melancholic indie folk sound, and status as one of the most acclaimed artists of her generation. She began her career in the mid-2010s and achieved breakthrough success with her 2020 album Punisher, which won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist and was widely considered one of the greatest albums of the year. Her collaboration with Matt Berninger as 7 Year Bender and as part of the supergroup Boygenius (with Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker) has further established her as a significant voice in contemporary indie music. Bridgers has been praised for her ability to address difficult topics including grief, anxiety, and loss with honesty and humor.
