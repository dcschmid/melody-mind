biography: "Nat King Cole, born Nathaniel Adams Coles, was an American singer and jazz pianist who became one of the most popular and influential entertainers of the 20th century. Beginning as a jazz pianist leading the King Cole Trio from 1937 to 1955, Cole transitioned to solo singing career, releasing over 100 singles including chart-topping hits like 'Mona Lisa,' 'Unforgettable,' and 'The Christmas Song.' His smooth baritone voice, sophisticated arrangements, and television presence as first African American to host a network variety show (1956-1957) broke racial barriers in entertainment. A Grammy Hall of Fame inductee and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Cole recorded over 1,500 songs and sold over 50 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time."
