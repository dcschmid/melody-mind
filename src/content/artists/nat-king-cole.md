biography: "Nat King Cole, born Nathaniel Adams Coles on March 17, 1919, in Montgomery, Alabama, was an American singer and jazz pianist who became one of the most popular and influential entertainers of the 20th century, beginning as a jazz pianist leading the King Cole Trio from 1937 to 1955 before transitioning to solo singing. Recording over 1,500 songs and selling over 50 million records worldwide, he achieved chart-topping hits like 'Mona Lisa,' 'Unforgettable,' and 'The Christmas Song' with his smooth baritone voice and sophisticated arrangements. As the first African American to host a network variety show (1956-1957), he broke racial barriers in entertainment while pioneering piano vocal jazz with the King Cole Trio. A Grammy Hall of Fame inductee and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee (1990), his recordings include 200 Billboard Hot 100 entries with 4 reaching number one: 'Straighten Up and Fly Right' (1943), 'The Christmas Song' (1946), 'Mona Lisa' (1950), and 'Too Young' (1951). He died on February 15, 1965, from lung cancer in Santa Monica, California at age 45, but his legacy continued through daughter Natalie Cole's Grammy-winning virtual duet 'Unforgettable' (1991)."
