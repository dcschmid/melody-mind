biography: "Cynthia Weil is an American singer-songwriter who became known as the 'Girl with the Big Voice' and pioneered expressive country-rock songwriting. Beginning as New York folk scene performer in 1966, Weil released hits like 'Poetry Man,' 'Dance Ten Jeffords with My Father,' and '(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet' that showcased her powerful vocals and confessional lyrics. Her 1971 self-titled album and follow-up 'Poetry Man' established her as one of most distinctive voices in 1970s. Known for vocal range and emotional depth, Weil influenced generations of singer-songwriters including Rickie Lee Jones, Stevie Nicks, and Aimee Mann. Though commercial success was limited, her cult following and critical acclaim have made her one of most respected artists in alternative rock."
