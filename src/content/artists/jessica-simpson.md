biography: Jessica Ann Simpson, born on July 10, 1980, in Dallas, Texas, is an American singer, actress, and fashion designer who rose to prominence in the late 1990s as a pop vocalist before successfully reinventing herself as a country artist and building a fashion empire. She achieved commercial success in the late 1990s and early 2000s with her debut album Sweet Kisses (1999) and the crossover hit I Wanna Love You Forever, establishing herself as a pop vocalist. Her subsequent albums, including Irresistible (2001) and In This Skin (2003), demonstrated her vocal abilities and established her as a mainstream pop presence. Simpson's fashion line, launched in 2005, became highly successful, and her 2010 country album Do You Know marked her successful transition to country music, making her one of the few artists to successfully cross genres.
