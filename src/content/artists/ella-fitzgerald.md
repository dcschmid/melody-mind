Her victory, which came after she had spent years performing in local venues and church choirs throughout Newport News and Richmond, Virginia, led directly to her engagement with Chick Webb's Orchestra, one of the most respected big bands of the swing era. This pivotal moment transformed her from a promising young local singer into a professional performer on the national jazz scene."

'A-Tisket, A-Tasket,' with its playful lyrics referencing a lost yellow basket, became an immediate jukebox sensation and established her distinctive vocal approach that blended swing rhythm with innovative melodic interpretation. These recordings marked her transition from reliable band vocalist to genuine star attraction capable of carrying commercial recordings."
  - year: "1938"
    event: "Recorded her definitive version of 'A-Tisket, A-Tasket' which solidified the song as her signature number and established her recording identity with jazz audiences nationwide, making the song one of the most requested recordings of the swing era. Shortly after these successful recordings, she made the difficult decision to leave the Chick Webb Orchestra following Webb's declining health, taking over leadership of the band and guiding it through a transitional period. This departure marked her emergence as an independent artist ready to establish her own musical identity on the national stage."

Her performances during these years, which included appearances at major ballrooms, theaters, and military bases, helped sustain American morale while establishing connections with influential musicians and arrangers who would later collaborate on her most ambitious projects. This period of intensive touring and professional relationship-building laid the groundwork for her postwar artistic flowering."
