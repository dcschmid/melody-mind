  Elvis Presley, born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, revolutionized popular music by fusing country, rhythm and blues, and gospel into a distinctive sound that defined the rock and roll era and transformed youth culture and racial boundaries in the global music industry.

His charismatic stage presence, controversial performance style, and unprecedented commercial success with RCA Victor recordings and films brought rock and roll to mainstream audiences worldwide. After serving in the US Army from 1958 to 1960, Presley continued his music career with renewed creativity, while his Las Vegas residencies and television appearances cemented his status as an entertainment legend. He died on August 16, 1977, in Memphis, Tennessee, but his legacy as "The King" continues to influence musicians and entertainers worldwide.
