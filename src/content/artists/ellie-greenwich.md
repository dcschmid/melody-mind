biography: |
  Ellie Greenwich, born Eleanor Louise Greenwich on October 23, 1940, in Brooklyn, New York, was a pioneering songwriter and producer who helped define the sound of 1960s pop music from New York's Brill Building. Working in collaboration with her husband Jeff Barry, she wrote or co-wrote some of the era's most enduring hits including "Leader of the Pack," "Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)," "Chapel of Love," and "River Deep, Mountain High," crafting catchy melodies and emotionally resonant lyrics that made her one of the most successful female songwriters of her era. Beyond songwriting, Greenwich was a performer who sang demos that became definitive versions of her compositions, with her voice heard on early recordings that became templates for later hits by more famous artists. She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1991 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010 for her influence on subsequent generations of songwriters, particularly women in the music industry. Greenwich died on August 26, 2018, from complications of surgery, but her songs continue to be recorded and performed worldwide.
