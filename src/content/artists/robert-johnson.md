careerTimeline:
  - year: "1911"
    event: "Born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi on May 8 to Julia Addicks Johnson; grew up in the cotton fields and juke joints of the Mississippi Delta region. His humble beginnings in one of America's poorest areas shaped the raw emotional depth that would characterize his haunting musical style. This environment of hardship and musical tradition provided the foundation for his later legendary recordings."
  - year: "1920s"
    event: "Learned guitar from local musicians including Willie Brown and Zackariah Feree, absorbing the Delta blues tradition firsthand from established masters. He also learned from the legendary Charley Patton, who taught him the fundamentals of slide guitar technique and song composition. These formative years in the competitive juke joint scene helped develop his unique fingerpicking style and powerful vocal delivery."
  - year: "1928"
    event: "Married Virginia Travis in a ceremony that reflected his attempts to establish stability in his wandering life as a traveling musician. The couple settled into family life in the Delta region where Johnson continued to develop his craft while working various jobs. This brief period of domestic happiness would soon be shattered by personal tragedy that deeply affected his songwriting."
  - year: "1929"
    event: "Wife Virginia died in childbirth along with their infant son, a devastating personal tragedy that profoundly shaped his melancholic songwriting and haunting lyrical themes. This experience of loss became a central theme in songs like 'Cross Road Blues' and 'Hellhound on My Trail,' adding emotional authenticity to his performances. The trauma pushed him deeper into music as both an emotional escape and means of survival."
  - year: "1930"
    event: "Left Mississippi following the devastating personal loss and traveled to Arkansas where he worked on plantation farms while performing at local venues. He continued to refine his guitar technique during this period of displacement and self-discovery in the Arkansas Delta. The traveling lifestyle exposed him to diverse regional blues styles that would influence his evolving musical approach."
  - year: "1931"
    event: "Returned to Mississippi with improved guitar skills and a more confident stage presence, beginning to play juke joints more seriously as a professional musician. He started building a regional reputation among the Black audiences who frequented the roadhouses and dance halls of the Delta. This period marked his transition from amateur player to serious contender in the competitive blues scene."
  - year: "1936"
    event: "Made his first recording session in San Antonio, Texas for ARC Records (American Record Corporation), traveling hundreds of miles to reach the studio that would capture his historic performances. The session was arranged by businessman Don Law, who had been sent South to discover authentic blues talent for the major record company. This opportunity transformed him from a regional performer into a recorded artist whose influence would echo through generations."
  - year: "1936"
    event: "Recorded 16 songs including 'Cross Road Blues,' 'Terraplane Blues,' and 'Stones in My Passway' during an intensive two-day session that captured his full artistic range. 'Terraplane Blues' became his most commercially successful recording during his lifetime, selling reasonably well for a race record of the era. These seminal recordings showcased his innovative guitar technique, powerful vocal delivery, and emotionally complex songwriting."
  - year: "1936"
    event: "Recordings were released on various subsidiary labels under the pseudonym 'Blind Lemon Jefferson' to capitalize on the famous bluesman's commercial success. This deceptive marketing decision meant Johnson's true identity remained largely unknown to the white audiences buying these records. The releases received modest sales but failed to establish Johnson as a known quantity in the rapidly changing blues market."
  - year: "1937"
    event: "Traveled to Dallas, Texas for his second and final recording session with Vocalion Records, again working with producer Don Law in a more professional studio environment.

The recordings demonstrated remarkable artistic growth and confidence compared to his first session."
  - year: "1937"
    event: "Recorded 13 more songs including 'Hellhound on My Trail,' 'Me and the Devil Blues,' and 'Love in Vain' that explored darker spiritual and supernatural themes. These compositions revealed Johnson's preoccupation with mortality, damnation, and the supernatural, possibly influenced by his personal tragedies and the superstitions of the Delta. 'Hellhound on My Trail' became particularly significant for its vivid imagery and was later covered by Led Zeppelin."
  - year: "1938"
    event: "Played extensively throughout Arkansas and Mississippi juke joints, building a reputation as a compelling performer despite his relatively unknown recording career. He developed a devoted local following who recognized his exceptional talent and innovative guitar work. This period of intensive live performance refined the skills that would later mesmerize rock musicians decades later."
  - year: "1938"
    event: "Died under mysterious circumstances on August 16 near Greenwood, Mississippi at just 27 years old, cutting short a career that would achieve legendary status posthumously. Contemporary accounts suggest he was poisoned by a jealous husband after allegedly having an affair with the man's wife at a juke joint. His death remains shrouded in mystery and legend, with conflicting stories about the exact circumstances and location."
  - year: "1938"
    event: "Contemporary reports suggest he was poisoned by a jealous husband who gave him whiskey laced with strychnine after Johnson allegedly slept with the man's wife. Some witnesses claimed he was bragging about his conquests, provoking the husband's rage and vengeful action. He died in terrible agony three days after the poisoning, making him one of the most tragic figures in blues history."
