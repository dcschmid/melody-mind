biography: |
  Marvin Gaye was the Prince of Soul who transformed R&B and popular music with his sophisticated vocals and production, beginning his career with instrumental jazz and standards before evolving into a soul innovator. His 1971 album Whats Going On was groundbreaking, addressing social issues like war, poverty, and environmentalism while pioneering concept albums in R&B, and Lets Get It On established him as a romantic soul master. With over 50 million records sold, Gaye won Grammy Awards and was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, with his influence on artists from Prince to Robin Thicke being profound. His smooth, intimate vocal style set new standards for production while his 1983 comeback hit Sexual Healing from Midnight Love reached number one on Billboard Hot 100. Gaye died tragically on April 1, 1984, one day before his 45th birthday, shot by his father, but his music continues to resonate with Whats Going On consistently ranked among the greatest albums of all time.
