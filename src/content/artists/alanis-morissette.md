  - year: "1980s"
    event: "Began dancing at age 2, training in ballet, jazz, and tap, developing her performance skills and stage presence from a young age in Canada's competitive arts scene. Her dedication to dance required years of rigorous training and discipline that would later translate into her work ethic as a musician. During this period, she also began writing poetry and songs, discovering her natural ability to express complex emotions through words."
  - year: "1987"
    event: "Appeared on Canadian television shows including You Can't Do That on Television, beginning her media career at age 13 and gaining early experience with camera work and performance under pressure. The show, filmed in Ottawa, provided her first exposure to national audiences and taught her valuable lessons about the entertainment industry. This early fame also gave her confidence in her abilities and desire to pursue a career in the arts."
  - year: "1989"
    event: "Released debut dance-pop album Alanis on MCA Records Canada, achieving moderate success in the Canadian market and introducing her as a teen pop artist. The album, produced by Leslie Howe, featured synth-heavy production typical of late 1980s pop music and showcased her vocal abilities even within a less personal genre. Despite its modest commercial performance, the album provided valuable experience in the recording studio and introduced her to industry professionals."
  - year: "1991"
    event: "Released Now Is the Time album, continuing her pop career while beginning to write more personal material that would eventually evolve into her breakthrough sound. The album showed slight evolution from her debut but still adhered to mainstream pop conventions that did not yet showcase her true artistic voice. However, during this period she was developing the introspective songwriting style that would later define her most successful work."
  - year: "1992"
    event: "Moved to Los Angeles to pursue her music career, leaving behind her teen pop image for a more authentic sound and beginning a period of intense personal and artistic development. This cross-border move represented a dramatic shift in her artistic direction and willingness to take creative risks that record company executives might consider too personal or unconventional. Los Angeles provided access to world-class songwriters and producers who could help her realize her evolving artistic vision."
  - year: "1995"
    event: "Released breakthrough album Jagged Little Pill on Maverick Records, which became one of the best-selling albums of all time with over 33 million copies sold worldwide and defining the sound of mid-1990s alternative rock. The album, produced by Glen Ballard, combined her raw emotional lyrics with alternative rock production, creating a sound that resonated with millions of listeners who felt underrepresented in mainstream pop. Its success was particularly remarkable given its unflinching honesty about topics like heartbreak, anger, and personal growth that were rarely addressed so directly in popular music."
  - year: "1995"
    event: "'You Oughta Know' became an instant classic known for its raw emotion and honest lyrics about heartbreak and betrayal, specifically addressing her relationship with former boyfriend and actor Ryan Reynolds. The song's aggressive guitar-driven sound and confrontational lyrics marked a dramatic departure from the polite pop music that dominated the early 1990s, establishing her as a voice for a generation of young women who felt unheard. Its impact on radio and cultural consciousness was immediate and lasting, with the song becoming an anthem for empowerment and emotional honesty."
  - year: "1996"
    event: "'Ironic' became a global hit, topping charts worldwide and defining the angsty tone of 1990s alternative rock while becoming one of the decade's most recognizable songs. Despite some debate about whether the situations described in the lyrics truly qualify as irony (as later discussed extensively in cultural criticism), the song connected with listeners through its exploration of life's disappointments and contradictions. The song's music video, directed by Marty Callner, featured her in a variety of settings that emphasized the disconnect between expectations and reality."
  - year: "1996"
    event: "Won Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, establishing her as a major artist in both the alternative rock and mainstream music worlds. Her Album of the Year win was particularly significant as she was the first Canadian and youngest artist to win the award in that category at that time. These awards validated her artistic vision and brought mainstream recognition to alternative rock's emotional depth and commercial potential."
  - year: "1998"
    event: "Released 'Uninvited' for the City of Angels soundtrack, earning another Grammy nomination and demonstrating her versatility as an artist capable of crossing genre boundaries.

Its inclusion in the Brad Pitt film brought her music to film audiences worldwide and expanded her fan base beyond alternative rock listeners."
  - year: "1998"
    event: "'Thank U' became her most politically charged single, addressing themes of gratitude and personal growth while incorporating social and environmental commentary rare in mainstream pop music. The song reflected her evolving maturity and willingness to address larger issues beyond personal relationships, marking a new phase in her songwriting. Its introspective lyrics about finding meaning in difficult experiences resonated with listeners who had followed her journey since Jagged Little Pill."
  - year: "1999"
    event: "Released Supposed to Be, exploring softer musical territory while maintaining her confessional songwriting approach that had become her trademark. The album featured more acoustic elements and less aggressive production, suggesting an artist reflecting on her rapid rise to fame and seeking balance in her life.

  - year: "2002"
