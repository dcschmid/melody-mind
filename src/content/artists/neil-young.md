  Neil Young, born Neil Percival Young on November 12, 1945, in Toronto, Ontario, is a Canadian-American singer-songwriter and guitarist known for his distinctive voice, versatility, and passionate advocacy for environmental causes, achieving breakthrough with "After the Gold Rush" (1970) and "Harvest" (1972). His ability to seamlessly transition between acoustic folk, electric garage rock, and country made him a unique figure in rock music, with albums like "Rust Never Sleeps" (1979) and "Harvest Moon" (1992) demonstrating his artistic range throughout his career. With over 48 million records sold and induction into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice) and the Songwriters Hall of Fame (2006), Young's influence on grunge, alternative rock, and indie music is profound, with artists from Kurt Cobain to Radiotext citing him as a major influence. Beyond music, he is a prominent environmental activist and founder of the Farm Aid benefit concert, with ongoing commitment to analog recording and vintage instruments influencing musicians who value craftsmanship over commercial success. At 79, Young continues to tour and record, maintaining his status as one of rock's most enduring and influential artists.
