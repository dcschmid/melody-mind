biography: |
  Minnie Riperton, born Minnie Julia Ripperton on November 8, 1947, in Chicago, Illinois, was an American singer-songwriter renowned for her extraordinary five-octave vocal range and ability to hit whistle notes, beginning her career with the experimental group Rotary Connection in the late 1960s. Her breakthrough came with "Love That Came from (Burning Spear)" (1975), followed by her signature song "Lovin' You" (1975) featuring the famous high note that demonstrated her remarkable vocal technique, with albums "Perfect Angel" (1974) and "Adventures in Paradise" (1975) showcasing jazz-influenced vocals and sophisticated songwriting. Throughout her career, Riperton balanced solo work with session singing for artists like Stevie Wonder and Jackson Browne, with her influence on vocal technique pioneers and soul artists evident in artists from Mariah Carey to Whitney Houston. Diagnosed with sickle cell trait in 1973 which later developed into cancer, she continued recording and performing while becoming an advocate for cancer awareness. She died on July 26, 1979, from cancer complications at age 31, but her legacy endures with "Lovin' You" remaining a standard and her Grammy win for Best New Artist (1976) cementing her place in music history.
