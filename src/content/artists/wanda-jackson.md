    event: "At just seventeen years old, began performing with country music star Hank Thompson's Brazos Valley Boys, one of the most popular Western swing bands in America, gaining invaluable stage experience and professional training that would shape her career. She recorded her first country singles for Decca Records, including 'You Can't Have My Love,' a duet with Billy Gray that reached number eight on the country charts, making her one of the youngest charting country artists of the era. This early success demonstrated her natural talent and charisma, catching the attention of the broader country music establishment in Nashville and beyond."
  - year: "1955"
    event: "Toured extensively with a young Elvis Presley on a package tour circuit across the American South and Midwest, during which the two developed a romantic relationship and Elvis personally encouraged her to abandon the constraints of traditional country music and embrace the raw energy of rock and roll. Presley's electrifying performances and rebellious spirit profoundly influenced Jackson, who began incorporating his hip-shaking energy and aggressive vocal style into her own act, transforming herself from a conventional country singer into something entirely new. This pivotal year, shaped by her personal and musical connection with Elvis, set the stage for her emergence as the first female rock and roll artist."
  - year: "1956"
    event: "Signed a recording contract with Capitol Records, one of the most prestigious labels in American music, and released her early rockabilly singles 'I Gotta Know' and 'Honey Bop,' which showcased her fierce, growling vocal style that was unlike anything female artists were producing at the time. These recordings blended the twang of country music with the driving rhythms and rebellious attitude of rock and roll, creating a sound that was thrilling, dangerous, and utterly original for a woman in 1950s America. Her Capitol Records deal gave her access to top-tier studios and musicians, providing the professional infrastructure to fully realize her groundbreaking artistic vision."
  - year: "1957"
    event: "Released 'Fujiyama Mama,' a wild, explosive rockabilly anthem that became a massive hit in Japan, selling over a million copies and establishing her as an international star, even as American radio stations hesitated to play such aggressive music by a female artist. She also released 'Hot Dog! That Made Him Mad,' another ferocious rocker that showcased her unmatched ability to deliver vocals with the raw power and attitude that male rock and rollers were celebrated for but women were expected to avoid. These breakthrough hits established her as the undisputed queen of female rockabilly, a pioneer who proved that women could rock just as hard as men."
  - year: "1958"

The song's success proved that her rockabilly style could achieve mainstream pop chart success and introduced her explosive energy to a wider American audience beyond the country and rockabilly circuits. 'Let's Have a Party' remains her most recognized song and an essential classic of the rock and roll canon."

Her continued chart success in 1960 confirmed her position as one of the most versatile and commercially viable female artists in American popular music."
