biography: Gary Numan, born Gary Anthony James Webb on March 8, 1958, in Hammersmith, London, is an English singer, musician, and songwriter widely regarded as a pioneer of electronic music and synth-pop. He achieved international fame in 1979 with his band Tubeway Army, releasing the albums Replicas and The Pleasure Principle, which featured the groundbreaking hits Cars and Are 'Friends' Electric? that defined the sound of synthesizers in popular music. His cold, mechanical vocal delivery combined with the haunting melodies of his synth-based compositions created a dystopian aesthetic that influenced countless electronic musicians and established him as a foundational figure in the development of synth-pop and industrial music.
