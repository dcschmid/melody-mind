biography: "Billie Holiday, born Eleanora Fagan and known as 'Lady Day,' revolutionized jazz singing through her emotional intensity, innovative phrasing, and deeply personal interpretation. Her distinctive voice and improvisational approach transformed popular songs into deeply emotional experiences, influencing generations of singers across jazz, pop, and soul. Holiday's artistry transcended technical perfection, prioritizing emotional truth and storytelling. Beyond music, she became an early civil rights activist through her recording of 'Strange Fruit' (1939), one of the first significant protest songs of the civil rights movement. Despite a troubled personal life, her artistic legacy remains unmatched among vocalists."
