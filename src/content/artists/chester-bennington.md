biography: Chester Charles Bennington, born on March 20, 1976, in Phoenix, Arizona, and died on July 20, 2017, was an American singer, songwriter, and actor best known as the lead vocalist of Linkin Park, one of the most successful rock bands of the 2000s and early 2010s. He joined Linkin Park in 1999 and helped the band achieve massive commercial success with their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which became the best-selling debut album of the 21st century with over 30 million copies sold worldwide. Bennington's powerful vocal range and emotional delivery, blending rock, hip-hop, and electronic elements, defined Linkin Park's sound and influenced a generation of rock vocalists. His struggles with mental health and substance abuse, which he openly discussed, made him an advocate for mental health awareness before his tragic death at age 41.
