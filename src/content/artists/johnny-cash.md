biography: Johnny Cash was an American singer-songwriter who achieved legendary status through his distinctive deep, resonant voice, his rebellion against convention, and his commitment to the marginalized and imprisoned. Born in Arkansas, he began his career in the 1950s and developed his "man in black" persona while performing in prisons, most famously Folsom Prison and San Quentin. His music blended country, rock and roll, rockabilly, folk, and blues, creating what would come to be called the "Cash sound." Beyond his music, Cash became a symbol of authenticity and rebellion, with a personal life as dramatic as his professional achievements.
