  Carlos Santana, born July 20, 1947, in Autlán de Navarro, Mexico, is a Mexican-American guitarist and songwriter who pioneered Latin rock by fusing Afro-Cuban rhythms with blues rock and jazz fusion, creating a distinctive sound through his virtuosic guitar playing and innovative use of effects. His breakthrough came with their performance at the 1969 Woodstock Festival, launching them to international stardom, followed by self-titled debut album (1969) and "Abraxas" (1970) with songs like "Black Magic Woman" and "Oye Como Va" becoming classics. Throughout the 1970s, Santana continued to innovate with albums like "Caravanserai" (1972) and "Amigos" (1976), exploring jazz fusion while maintaining their Latin roots through extended improvisations and a spiritual approach to music. They achieved a remarkable commercial comeback with "Supernatural" (1999), winning nine Grammy Awards including Album of the Year, with the album's fusion of Latin rhythms with contemporary pop producing massive hits like "Smooth" and "Maria Maria." Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Santana has won numerous Grammy Awards throughout his career while continuing to record and tour at 76, sharing his spiritual approach to music with new generations of fans.
