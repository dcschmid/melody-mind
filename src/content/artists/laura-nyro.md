  Laura Nyro, born Laura Rosa Nyro on October 18, 1947, in the Bronx, New York, was an American singer-songwriter whose innovative fusion of soul, folk, jazz, and gospel influenced generations of musicians, achieving breakthrough with "Eli and the Thirteenth Confession" (1968). Her songs were recorded by major artists including The Fifth Dimension ("Wedding Bell Blues"), Blood, Sweat & Tears ("And When I Die"), and Barbra Streisand ("Stoney End"), while she remained true to her artistic vision, refusing to compromise her complex compositions for commercial success. Nyro died of ovarian cancer on April 18, 1997, at age 49, but her influence on singer-songwriters, particularly women, has been profound, with artists from Suzanne Vega to Tori Amos citing her as a major influence. She was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2017, with her albums "New York Tendaberry" (1969) and "Gonna Take a Miracle" (1971) demonstrating her artistic evolution. Her music continues to inspire new generations of artists who appreciate her emotional intensity and musical innovation.
