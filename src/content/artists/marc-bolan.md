biography: |
  Marc Bolan pioneered glam rock as the frontman of T-Rex, transforming from folk-rock psychedelic troubadour to glitter-suit-wearing pop star. His breakthrough came with the electric version of T-Rex in 1970, when Hot Love and Get It On dominated the charts, and his 1971 album Electric Warrior became a massive success establishing him as the king of glam rock. Throughout the early 1970s, T-Rex scored numerous hits, making Bolan a teen idol whose catchy melodies, simple lyrics, and flamboyant stage presence defined the glam era while influencing fashion and youth culture. His career declined in the mid-1970s as punk rock emerged, but his influence on subsequent generations of musicians from Bowie to the Sex Pistols was profound. Bolan died tragically in a car crash on September 16, 1977, just two weeks before his 30th birthday, but his legacy as the godfather of glam rock endures.
