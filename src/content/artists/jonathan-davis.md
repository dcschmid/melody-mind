biography: Jonathan Reginald Davis, born on January 18, 1971, in Bakersfield, California, is an American musician, songwriter, and producer best known as the lead vocalist and frontman of Korn, one of the founding bands of the nu metal genre that emerged in the mid-1990s. He joined Korn in 1993 and helped the band achieve breakthrough success with their self-titled debut album in 1994, which established their distinctive sound blending heavy metal, hip-hop, and industrial elements. Davis's unique vocal style, incorporating rapping, screaming, and melodic singing, along with his use of bagpipes and other unconventional instruments, has made him one of the most recognizable figures in rock music. Korn has sold over 30 million records worldwide, and Davis has maintained his role as the band's lead singer while pursuing solo projects and collaborations.
