biography: |
  Mary Isabelle "Dusty" Springfield, born on April 16, 1939, in West Hampstead, London, was the definitive "white soul" singer of the 1960s who developed her distinctive contralto voice and emotive style with The Springfields before launching her solo career. Springfield's breakthrough came with "I Only Want to Be with You" (1963), followed by sophisticated pop-soul hits including "The Look of Love," "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me," and "Son of a Preacher Man" (1968), while her 1969 album "Dusty in Memphis," recorded with Atlantic Records' legendary team, is considered one of the greatest soul albums ever. Though she never achieved major commercial success in America, Springfield became a cult figure whose influence on artists from Adele to Amy Winehouse is profound, with her impeccable taste in material and ability to interpret soul music making her a favorite of musicians and critics alike. She won numerous awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 for her impact on female soul singers and the perception of white artists performing black music. Springfield died of breast cancer on March 2, 1999, but her legacy as one of the great interpretive singers of the 20th century endures.
