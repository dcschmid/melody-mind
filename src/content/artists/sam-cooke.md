biography: "Sam Cooke, born Samuel Cook, was an American singer, songwriter, and civil rights activist who pioneered soul music and became one of most influential vocalists in American history. Beginning as gospel singer with The Soul Stirrers from 1950 to 1957, Cooke transitioned to secular music, recording 29 Top 40 hits including 19 Top 10 singles like 'You Send Me,' 'A Change Is Gonna Come,' and 'Bring It On Home to Me.' Known as 'King of Soul,' Cooke's smooth baritone and emotional delivery defined modern pop and R&B. A Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee and Grammy Hall of Fame honoree, Cooke founded SAR Records and wrote socially conscious anthems like 'A Change Is Gonna Come,' which became civil rights movement standard. His songs have sold over 25 million copies worldwide."
