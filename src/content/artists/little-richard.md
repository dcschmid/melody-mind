biography: "Little Richard, often called 'The Architect of Rock and Roll,' pioneered the high-energy sound and flamboyant performance style that became synonymous with rock music. His explosive vocals, pounding piano playing, and wild stage antics shattered racial barriers and redefined live performance. Songs like 'Tutti Frutti' and 'Long Tall Sally' created the template for rock and roll's raw energy. His influence spans generations, inspiring artists from James Brown and The Beatles to Prince and David Bowie. Richard was among the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993."
