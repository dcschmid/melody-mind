His explosive vocals, pounding piano playing, and wild stage antics shattered racial barriers and redefined live performance. Songs like 'Tutti Frutti' and 'Long Tall Sally' created the template for rock and roll's raw energy. His influence spans generations, inspiring artists from James Brown and The Beatles to Prince and David Bowie.
