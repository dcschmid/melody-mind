biography: |
  Fela Anikulapo Kuti, born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti on October 15, 1938, in Abeokuta, Nigeria, was a revolutionary musician and political activist who pioneered Afrobeat, blending traditional Yoruba music with jazz, highlife, and funk after returning to Nigeria in 1963. His 1970 album established the Afrobeat sound, while "Zombie" (1977) became an international bestseller despite being banned in Nigeria, with lyrics criticizing military dictatorship, colonialism, and corruption making his music inseparable from his politics. With over 50 million records sold and influence on artists from Paul McCartney to Public Enemy, Kuti's 1977 arrest and torture after the raid on the Kalakuta Republic became an international incident, earning him repeated imprisonment and harassment from Nigerian authorities. He received numerous international awards recognizing his contributions to music and human rights, while his son Seun Kuti continues the Afrobeat tradition today. Kuti died on August 2, 1997, from AIDS-related complications, but his legacy as a musical innovator and political revolutionary endures.
