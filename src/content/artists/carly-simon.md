biography: |
  Carly Simon, born on June 25, 1945, in New York City, emerged as one of the most distinctive voices of the 1970s singer-songwriter movement. After forming a brief duo with her sister Lucy, she launched her solo career in 1971 with a self-titled album and achieved breakthrough with "You're So Vain" (1972), one of pop history's most analyzed songs. Throughout the 1970s, she dominated the charts with albums like "No Secrets" (1972), "Hotcakes" (1974), and "Boys in the Trees" (1978), becoming known for her confessional songwriting style tackling themes of love, vulnerability, and independence. Simon won two Grammy Awards and made history as the first woman to win both Grammy and Academy Award for "Let the River Run" from "Working Girl" (1988). Her influence on female singer-songwriters from Taylor Swift to Sara Bareilles continues to be acknowledged, with her catalog of 13 Top 40 hits and 24 Billboard entries cementing her legacy.
