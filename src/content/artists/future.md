biography: Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn, known professionally as Future, born on November 20, 1983, in Atlanta, Georgia, is an American rapper, singer, and producer who has become one of the most influential figures in trap music, known for his auto-tuned vocals, melancholic lyrics about drug use and excess, and prolific output. He rose to prominence in the early 2010s with a series of mixtapes and albums including Pluto (2012), Future (2017), and Hndrxx (2017), the latter of which marked a more introspective turn. Future has sold over 30 million records worldwide and has influenced a generation of trap artists with his distinctive sound and emotional vulnerability. His influence on hip-hop and his role in popularizing auto-tune as an artistic tool have been significant.
