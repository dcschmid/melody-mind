biography: |
  George Clinton, born on July 22, 1941, in Kannapolis, North Carolina, is a visionary musician and producer who created Parliament-Funkadelic (P-Funk), one of the most influential collectives in music history, beginning his career in the 1950s as a doo-wop singer before forming The Parliaments in 1965. Clinton's genius was creating a musical universe encompassing funk, psychedelic rock, soul, and later electronic music, developing the "P-Funk" sound with Parliament and Funkadelic—an eclectic mix of funk rhythms, rock guitars, and science fiction themes with elaborate live shows featuring the iconic Mothership. With over 40 albums and influence on virtually every subsequent genre from hip-hop to electronic dance music, Parliament's "Mothership Connection" (1975) established funk as a major force, while "One Nation Under a Groove" (1978) became a crossover phenomenon. Clinton has been sampled by countless artists from Public Enemy and Ice Cube to Michael Jackson and Kanye West, and his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1997) recognized his influence on multiple genres and generations of musicians. At 83, he continues to tour and record, keeping the P-Funk legacy alive while introducing new audiences to the music that helped shape modern popular culture.
