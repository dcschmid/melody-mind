biography: |
  Howlin' Wolf, born Chester Arthur Burnett on June 10, 1910, in West Point, Mississippi, was one of the most influential Chicago blues singers and guitarists of the 20th century known for his imposing physical presence (6'6" and 300 lbs) and thunderous voice that ranged from growls to falsettos. Recording for Chess Records from 1951 to 1962, Wolf created enduring blues classics including "Spoonful" and "Smokestack Lightnin'" that became genre-defining tracks and staples for countless rock, blues, and R&B artists. His raw emotional delivery and innovative arrangements with guitarist Hubert Sumlin shaped the development of modern blues and rock music, influencing artists from The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin to Eric Clapton and The Doors. A Grammy Hall of Fame inductee and member of both the Blues Hall of Fame (1980) and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1991), Wolf's legacy continues through his 1971 London Sessions collaboration with British rock stars. He died on January 10, 1976, from heart failure in Chicago at age 65, but his influence on blues and rock music endures.
