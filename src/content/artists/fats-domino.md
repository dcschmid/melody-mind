biography: Antoine Dominic Domino, born on February 26, 1928, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was an American pianist and singer-songwriter who became one of the most influential figures in early rock and roll and rhythm and blues, known for his boogie-woogie piano style, relaxed vocal delivery, and role in bridging New Orleans rhythm with mainstream popularity. He rose to prominence in the late 1940s and achieved breakthrough success with The Fat Man (1949), which sold over a million copies and is considered one of the first rock and roll records. His subsequent hits including Blueberry Hill (1956), Ain't That a Shame (1955), and Walking to New Orleans (1959) established him as a crossover star who brought New Orleans music to national audiences. Domino's influence on rock and roll was profound, with his piano-driven style and relaxed stage presence influencing countless artists including Elvis Presley, who cited him as a major inspiration.
