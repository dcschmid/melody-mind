biography: |
  Otis Ray Redding, born on September 9, 1941, in Dawson, Georgia, was an American singer-songwriter who became the "King of Soul" and one of the most influential artists in music history, developing his powerful, emotionally intense vocal style while touring relentlessly throughout the 1960s after breakthrough with "These Arms of Mine" (1962). His 1965 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival brought him to national attention, while albums like "Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul" (1965) and "Complete and Unbelievable" (1967) established him as a major artist with his version of "Try a Little Tenderness" (1967) becoming one of the most covered songs in history. Redding's influence extended beyond soul to rock, funk, and R&B, with artists from the Rolling Stones to the Beatles acknowledging his impact as the first artist to headline at the Whiskey a Go Go in Los Angeles. He died tragically on December 10, 1967, when his plane crashed into Lake Monona in Wisconsin, killing him at age 26, but his posthumous album "(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay" became the first #1 posthumous single. His legacy as one of the greatest soul singers of all time endures, with his music continuing to influence generations of artists and his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1989) cementing his place in music history.
