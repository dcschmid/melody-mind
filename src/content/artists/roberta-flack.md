biography: |
  Roberta Flack is an American singer-songwriter known for her soulful, understated vocals and sophisticated musical arrangements, beginning her career teaching music in Washington DC before being discovered by Les McCann in 1969. Her breakthrough came with debut album First Take in 1969 and her 1973 album Killing Me Softly established her as a major artist with the title track becoming one of the most iconic soul ballads of the era, while she achieved numerous hits including Feel Like Makin Love and Where Is the Love. She won four Grammy Awards in 1974, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year for Killing Me Softly, making her the first artist to win both awards in consecutive years, with her ability to blend R&B, jazz, and pop creating a sophisticated sound. Her influence on the quiet storm and adult contemporary formats has been profound, though her commercial success declined in the 1980s she has continued recording and performing into the 2020s. Her legacy as one of the most sophisticated and influential soul singers of her era endures with her 2012 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award cementing her place in music history.
