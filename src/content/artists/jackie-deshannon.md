biography: |
  Jackie DeShannon, born Sharon Lee Kilmartin on August 21, 1941, in Hazel, Kentucky, was a pioneering singer-songwriter who helped bridge the gap between folk and pop music in the 1960s and achieved breakthrough with "When You Walk in the Room" (1964). Her 1965 composition "What the World Needs Now Is Love," written with Burt Bacharach, became an anthem of hope and tolerance, while she wrote or co-wrote numerous hits including "Put a Little Love in Your Heart" (1969), "Bette Davis Eyes" (1974), and "The Weight" (with The Band), crafting memorable melodies and meaningful lyrics. DeShannon was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2010 for her contributions to American music, with her influence on subsequent generations of singer-songwriters, particularly women in the industry, widely acknowledged. Beyond music, she has been involved in environmental causes and social justice issues throughout her career, with her message of love and unity continuing to resonate. At 83, DeShannon remains an influential figure in American music, with her songs continuing to be covered and celebrated.
