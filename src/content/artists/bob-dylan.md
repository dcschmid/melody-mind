biography: "Bob Dylan, born Robert Zimmerman, is an American singer-songwriter, author, and visual artist who became one of most influential figures in American culture. Emerging from Greenwich Village folk revival in 1961, Dylan pioneered confessional songwriting and poetic lyrics, releasing over 600 songs including 'Blowin' in the Wind,' 'The Times They Are a-Changin',' and 'Like a Rolling Stone.' His distinctive nasal vocals, acoustic guitar, and harmonica playing defined folk rock and influenced generations of songwriters. A Nobel Prize in Literature laureate (2016), 10-time Grammy winner, and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Dylan's work spans six decades and continues to influence popular music."
