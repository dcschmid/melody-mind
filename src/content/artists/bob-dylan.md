biography: "Bob Dylan, born Robert Zimmerman on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota, is an American singer-songwriter who became one of the most influential figures in American culture. Emerging from the Greenwich Village folk revival in 1961, Dylan pioneered confessional songwriting and poetic lyrics, releasing over 600 songs including 'Blowin' in the Wind,' 'The Times They Are a-Changin',' and 'Like a Rolling Stone.' His distinctive nasal vocals, acoustic guitar, and harmonica playing defined folk rock and influenced generations of songwriters. Dylan's work spans six decades and he continues to influence popular music as a touring artist. A Nobel Prize in Literature laureate (2016), 10-time Grammy winner, and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, his cultural impact remains unparalleled."
