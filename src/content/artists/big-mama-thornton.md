biography: |
  Big Mama Thornton, born Willie Mae Thornton on December 11, 1926, in Montgomery, Alabama, was a pioneering blues and R&B vocalist whose powerful voice and commanding stage presence influenced generations of rock and blues artists. She originated two of rock and roll's most iconic songs: "Hound Dog" (1952), which she co-wrote and topped R&B charts for seven weeks, and "Ball and Chain" (1961), later popularized by Janis Joplin. Thornton's raw, uncompromising vocal style challenged gender norms in the music industry and established a template for female rock and blues singers. Despite limited commercial success compared to her later interpreters, she earned critical recognition including Grammy nominations and induction into the Blues Hall of Fame. Her powerful contralto voice and dynamic performances continue to inspire artists across multiple generations.
