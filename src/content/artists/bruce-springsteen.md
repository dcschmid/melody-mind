biography: |
  Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen, born on September 23, 1949, in Freehold Borough, New Jersey, is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist known as The Boss for his passionate performances and working-class anthems. He developed his sound in the 1960s and 1970s, leading the E Street Band through a series of critically acclaimed albums that established heartland rock as a genre. His breakthrough album Born to Run (1975) created a cinematic sound combining poetic lyrics with ambitious production, featuring anthems like Thunder Road and the title track that became defining moments in rock history. Throughout his five-decade career, Springsteen has sold over 65 million records in the United States alone, won 20 Grammy Awards, and earned an Academy Award for Streets of Philadelphia (1994). His concerts are legendary for their marathon length and emotional intensity, while his advocacy for labor rights, veterans' causes, and progressive politics has made him a cultural icon beyond music.
