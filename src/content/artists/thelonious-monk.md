biography: "Thelonious Monk was an American jazz pianist and composer who pioneered bebop and modern jazz, creating distinctive angular melodies and dissonant harmonies that became his signature style. A founder of bebop alongside Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, Monk composed over 70 jazz standards including 'Round Midnight,' 'Blue Monk,' and 'Epistrophy.' Known for unconventional technique, abrupt chord changes, and unique improvisational approach, Monk influenced generations of jazz musicians including John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Herbie Hancock. A 5-time Grammy winner and National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, Monk was inducted into Grammy Hall of Fame for 'Round Midnight' and received posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993."
